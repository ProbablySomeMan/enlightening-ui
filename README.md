# enlightening-ui
A simple CSS UI library that aims to put a little light in the viewer's browser...

## The goal of the library 

I wanted to share my little ui system that I use for my blog. This repository, 
however, aims to package it into reusable elements. I plan to either implement
them as components in the near future, or to create a very serious fork that is
going to take care of aspects like these.
